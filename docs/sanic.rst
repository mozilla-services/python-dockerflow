Sanic
=====

The package ``dockerflow.sanic`` package implements various tools to support
Sanic based projects that want to follow the Dockerflow specs:

- A Python logging formatter following the `mozlog`_ format.

- A Sanic extension implements:

  - Emitting of `request.summary`_ log records based on request specific data.

  - Views for health monitoring:

    - ``/__version__`` - Serves a ``version.json`` file

    - ``/__heartbeat__`` - Runs the configured Dockerflow checks

    - ``/__lbheartbeat__`` - Retuns a HTTP 200 response

  - Signals for passed and failed heartbeats.

  - Built-in Dockerflow checks for SQLAlchemy and Redis connections
    and validating Alembic migrations.

  - Hooks to add custom Dockerflow checks.

Setup
-----

To install ``python-dockerflow``'s Sanic support please follow these steps:

#. In your code where your Sanic application lives set up the dockerflow Sanic
   extension::

     from sanic import Sanic
     from dockerflow.sanic import Dockerflow

     app = Sanic(__name__)
     dockerflow = Dockerflow(app)

#. Make sure the app root path is set correctly as this will be used
   to locate the ``version.json`` file that is generated by
   CircleCI or another process during deployment.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`sanic-versions` for more information

#. Configure logging to use the ``JsonLogFormatter`` logging formatter for the
   ``request.summary`` logger (you may have to extend your existing logging
   configuration), see :ref:`sanic-logging` for more information.

.. _sanic-config:

Configuration
-------------

.. epigraph::

   Accept its configuration through environment variables.

There are several options to handle configuration values through
environment variables when configuring Sanic.

Sanic configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest is to use Sanic's own ability to access environment variables
for settings and other variables.

    Any variables defined with the ``SANIC_`` prefix will be applied to the
    sanic config. For example, setting ``SANIC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`` will be
    loaded by the application automatically and fed into the
    ``REQUEST_TIMEOUT`` config variable.

    -- :doc:`Sanic docs on configuration <sanic/config>`.

The downside of that is that it nicely works only for string
based variables, since that's what ``os.environ`` returns.

python-decouple
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A good replacement is python-decouple_ as it's agnostic to the
framework in use and offers casting the returned value to the type
wanted, e.g.::

    from decouple import config

    MY_SETTING = config('SANIC_MY_SETTING', default='default value')
    DEBUG = config('SANIC_DEBUG', default=False, cast=bool)

As you can see the ``DEBUG`` configuration value would be populated from
the ``SANIC_DEBUG`` environment variable but also be cast as a boolean
(while considering the string values ``'1'``, ``'yes'``, ``'true'`` and
``'on'`` as truthy values, and similar for falsey values).

sanic-envconfig
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to solve more complex configuration scenarios there are tools
like sanic-envconfig_ which allows loading settings for different
environments (e.g. dev, stage, prod) via environment variables.
It provides a small Python base class to allow setting up the configuration
values:

E.g. in a ``config.py`` file next to your application::

    from sanic_envconfig import EnvConfig

    class Dev(EnvConfig):
        DEBUG: bool = True
        DB_URL: str = None
        WORKERS: int = 1
        PORT: int = 5000

    class Prod(Dev):
        DEBUG: bool = False

Then in your application code::

    import os
    from sanic import Sanic

    app = Sanic(__name__)
    app.config.from_object(os.environ.get('SANIC_CONFIG', 'config.Dev'))

In that example the configuration class that is given in the
``SANIC_CONFIG`` environment variable would be used to update
the default Sanic configuration values while allowing to override
the values via environment variables.

It's recommended to use the sanic-envconfig feature to define a prefix for the
environment variable it uses to check, e.g.::

    from sanic_envconfig import EnvConfig

    class Dev(EnvConfig):
        _ENV_PREFIX = 'ACME_'
        DEBUG = True

To override the config value of ``DEBUG`` the environment variable would be
called ``ACME_DEBUG``.

.. _sanic-serving:

``PORT``
--------

.. epigraph::

   Listen on environment variable ``$PORT`` for HTTP requests.

Depending on which WSGI server you are using to run your Python application
there are different ways to accept the :envvar:`PORT` as the port to launch
your application with.

It's recommended to use port ``8000`` by default.

Gunicorn
~~~~~~~~

Gunicorn automatically will bind to the hostname:port combination of
``0.0.0.0:$PORT`` if it find the :envvar:`PORT` environment variable.
That means running gunicorn is as simple as using this, for example::

    gunicorn myproject:app --worker-class sanic.worker.GunicornWorker

.. seealso::

    The `full gunicorn documentation <http://docs.gunicorn.org/>`_
    for more details.

ASGI
~~~~

Sanic is also ASGI-compliant. This means you can use your preferred ASGI
webserver to run Sanic. The three main implementations of ASGI are Daphne,
Uvicorn, and Hypercorn.

.. seealso::

    The :doc:`Sanic deployment documentation <sanic/deploying>` has more
    for more details.

.. _sanic-versions:

Versions
--------

.. epigraph::

   Must have a JSON version object at /app/version.json.

Dockerflow requires writing a `version object`_ to the file
``/app/version.json`` as seen from the docker container to be served under
the URL path ``/__version__``.

To facilitate this python-dockerflow comes with a Sanic view to read the
file under the current worked directory (``.``).

If you'd like to override the location from which the view is reading the
``version.json`` file from, simply override the optional ``version_path``
parameter to the :class:`~dockerflow.sanic.app.Dockerflow` class, e.g.::

    from sanic import Sanic
    from dockerflow.sanic import Dockerflow

    app = Sanic(__name__)
    dockerflow = Dockerflow(app, version_path='/app')

Alternatively if you'd like to completely override the way the version
information is read use the
:meth:`~dockerflow.sanic.app.Dockerflow.version_callback` decorator to
decorate a callback that gets the ``version_path`` value passed. E.g.::

    import json
    from sanic import Sanic
    from dockerflow.sanic import Dockerflow

    app = Sanic(__name__)
    dockerflow = Dockerflow(app)

    @dockerflow.version_callback
    def my_version(root):
        return json.loads(os.path.join(root, 'acme_version.json'))

.. _version object: https://github.com/mozilla-services/Dockerflow/blob/master/docs/version_object.md

.. _sanic-health:

Health monitoring
-----------------

Health monitoring happens via three different views following the Dockerflow_
spec:

.. http:get:: /__version__

   The view that serves the :ref:`version information <sanic-versions>`.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /__version__ HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   **Example response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Vary: Accept-Encoding
      Content-Type: application/json

      {
        "commit": "52ce614fbf99540a1bf6228e36be6cef63b4d73b",
        "version": "2017.11.0",
        "source": "https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-analysis-service",
        "build": "https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/telemetry-analysis-service/2223"
      }

   :statuscode 200: no error
   :statuscode 404: a version.json wasn't found

.. http:get:: /__heartbeat__

   The heartbeat view will go through the list of registered Dockerflow
   checks, run each check and add their results to a JSON response.

   The view will return HTTP responses with either an status code of 200 if
   all checks ran successfully or 500 if there was one or more warnings or
   errors returned by the checks.

   **Built-in Dockerflow checks:**

   There are a few built-in checks that are automatically added to the list
   of checks if the appropriate Sanic extension objects are passed to
   the :class:`~dockerflow.sanic.app.Dockerflow` class during instantiation.

   For detailed examples please see the API documentation for the built-in
   :ref:`Sanic Dockerflow checks <sanic-checks>`.

   **Custom Dockerflow checks:**

   To write your own custom Dockerflow checks simply write a function
   that returns a list of one or many check message instances representing
   the severity of the check result. The :mod:`dockerflow.sanic.checks`
   module contains a series of predefined check messages for the
   severity levels: :class:`~dockerflow.sanic.checks.Debug`,
   :class:`~dockerflow.sanic.checks.Info`,
   :class:`~dockerflow.sanic.checks.Warning`,
   :class:`~dockerflow.sanic.checks.Error`,
   :class:`~dockerflow.sanic.checks.Critical`.

   Here's an example of a check that handles various levels of exceptions
   from an external storage system with different check message::

       from sanic import Sanic
       from dockerflow.sanic import checks, Dockerflow

       app = Sanic(__name__)
       dockerflow = Dockerflow(app)

       @dockerflow.check
       async def storage_reachable():
           result = []
           try:
               acme.storage.ping()
           except SlowConnectionException as exc:
               result.append(checks.Warning(exc.msg, id='acme.health.0002'))
           except StorageException as exc:
               result.append(checks.Error(exc.msg, id='acme.health.0001'))
           return result

    also works without async::

       @dockerflow.check
           def storage_reachable():
               result = []
               # ...

   Notice the use of the :meth:`~dockerflow.sanic.app.Dockerflow.check`
   decorator to mark the check to be used.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /__heartbeat__ HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   **Example response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
      Vary: Accept-Encoding
      Content-Type: application/json

      {
        "status": "warning",
        "checks": {
          "check_debug": "ok",
          "check_sts_preload": "warning"
        },
        "details": {
          "check_sts_preload": {
            "status": "warning",
            "level": 30,
            "messages": {
              "security.W021": "You have not set the SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD setting to True. Without this, your site cannot be submitted to the browser preload list."
            }
          }
        }
      }

   :statuscode 200: no error
   :statuscode 500: there was a warning or error

.. http:get:: /__lbheartbeat__

   The view that simply returns a successful HTTP response so that a load
   balancer in front of the application can check that the web application
   has started up.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /__lbheartbeat__ HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   **Example response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Vary: Accept-Encoding
      Content-Type: application/json

   :statuscode 200: no error

.. _sanic-logging:

Logging
-------

Dockerflow provides a :class:`~dockerflow.logging.JsonLogFormatter` Python
logging formatter class.

To use it, pass something like this to your Sanic app when it is initialized
for at least the ``request.summary`` logger::

    from sanic import Sanic

    log_config = {
        'version': 1,
        'formatters': {
            'json': {
                '()': 'dockerflow.logging.JsonLogFormatter',
                'logger_name': 'myproject'
            }
        },
        'handlers': {
            'console': {
                'level': 'DEBUG',
                'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
                'formatter': 'json'
            },
        },
        'loggers': {
            'request.summary': {
                'handlers': ['console'],
                'level': 'DEBUG',
            },
        }
    })

    sanic = Sanic(__name__, log_config=log)

By default the ``log_info`` parameter has the value of
``sanic.log.LOGGING_CONFIG_DEFAULTS``.

Alternatively you can also pass the same logging config dictionary to the
``logging.conf.dictConfig`` utility **BEFORE** your Sanic app is initialized::

    from logging.conf import dictConfig
    from sanic import Sanic

    log_config = {
        # ...
    }

    dictConfig(log_config)

    sanic = Sanic(__name__)

:doc:`serving static files <sanic/static_files>` for more information.
